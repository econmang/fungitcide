# Introduction

Fungitcide is a terminal user interface (TUI) to aid in management of git-related tasks... _More to follow, as I create it_

### Why the name?

Since Rust is named after a fungus, I thought to create a package with a name that sounded like fungicide and allowed me to use the command `fungit` to launch.


### Inspiration

If you find this project interesting, please check out [lazygit](https://github.com/jesseduffield/lazygit), from which this product draws inspiration.
The goal was to create a similar interface to the lazygit project, but written in Rust as opposed to Go.
